# MIQP-for-path-planning-and-collosion-avoidance-for-an-USV

In these repository, Mixed-Integer-Quadratic-Programming (MIQP) is utilized as an high level controller. This controller produces reference yaw angle and reference surge speed values for low level Linear Model Predictive Controller.

At the end of the simulation, graphs obtained from logs are automatically plotted.
